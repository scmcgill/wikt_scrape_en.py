## Wikt
#### Webscraper for Wiktionary translations of English words in French, Spanish, German, Arabic, and Persian.  

#### General Notes
- Some sections like "English", etc., not separated into own divs.  
- How to deal with scraping the part of speech?

#### To-Do
- Make list of all parts of speech and select translations from each.  
- Site seems to to things like this instead of using divs for language sections/different translations.  
- foreign-to-english scripts
- Some words with lots of translations, like "book", link to another page that has translation tables.  Need to check for this and get the url of the linked page and run the function on that page instead.  [edit: working now].   
- what to do about errors for when a page does not exist?
