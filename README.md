## Wikt
#### Webscraper for Wiktionary translations of English words in French, Spanish, German, Arabic, and Persian.  

#### General Notes
- Grabs translations from all tables on a page (i.e., both verb and noun for a word like "record").  
#### To-Do
- Include part of speech to output.  
- have translations from a given language print on the same line, separated by commas.  
- use check_linked_translation function to search for grammatical info on a word if it has a link to its own page.  
- foreign-to-english scripts
- need to add option flags to refine search to a particular language/part of speech
- what to do about errors for when a page does not exist?
- how to not print English meaning for words that do not have a translation in any target languages?
